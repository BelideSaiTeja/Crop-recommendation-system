# Crop-recommendation-system

A simple ML based model which recommends the best crop to grow.

# DISCLAIMER
This is a Proof of Concept(PoC) kind of project. The data used here comes up with no gurantee of any proofs. So. dont use it for any practical decisions. However this projects presents the idea that how ML is used into farming decisions based on the authentic and large datasets to develop it on a large scale for farming decisions.

# STIMULATION

Farming is one of the major sectors that influences a countryâ€™s economic growth.

In country like India, majority of the population is dependent on agriculture for their livelihood. Many new technologies, such as Machine Learning and Deep Learning, are being implemented into agriculture so that it is easier for farmers to grow and maximize their yield.
In this project, I presented a Crop Recommendation System as follows:
  * In the crop recommendation system, the user can provide the soil data from their side and the application will predict which crop should the user grow.

# FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
 * Model can be deployed on any Platform to make it user friendly 
 * More data can be collected manually via web scrapping to make the system more accurate
 * Additional plant data can be collected to make the crop recommendation to make it more robust and generalized
